            ### 🌟 **You Are Not Alone, and You Are Strong! 🌟**
            Finding out that you might have PCOS can feel overwhelming, but remember: **this is just the beginning of a journey to better health and well-being.** Here are some empowering truths to hold onto:

            1. **You Are Not Defined by PCOS:**  
               PCOS is a condition, not your identity. It’s something you *manage*, not something that defines who you are.

            2. **You Have Support:**  
               Millions of women worldwide face PCOS, and there’s a vast community of people, healthcare providers, and resources to guide you. You don’t have to navigate this alone.

            3. **Your Body Is Resilient:**  
               With the right lifestyle changes, medical support, and self-care, many women with PCOS go on to lead healthy, vibrant lives. Small steps—like eating nourishing foods, moving your body, and managing stress—can make a big difference.

            4. **You’re Taking the First Step:**  
               By seeking answers and completing this questionnaire, you’ve already shown courage and a desire to prioritize your health. That’s a powerful move toward understanding and empowerment.

            5. **Hope Is Ahead:**  
               Advances in medicine and holistic care mean there are more options than ever to manage PCOS symptoms and improve quality of life. Whether it’s regulating hormones, achieving fertility goals, or simply feeling better day-to-day—you *can* thrive.

            ### 💬 **Remember: Progress Over Perfection**  
            Take one step at a time. Celebrate small victories, and don’t hesitate to reach out to healthcare professionals or supportive communities for guidance.

            You are **strong**, you are **capable**, and you have the power to take control of your health. This isn’t the end of the story—it’s the start of a brighter, healthier chapter. 💖✨
